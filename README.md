## Description
In this work, the  guidance technique of pure pursuit is adopted and modified for quadrotors. This work focuses on the development of vision-assisted guidance techniques for landing of a quadrotor. The concern of a guidance strategy is to enable persistent tracking of the landing pad or track a specific landing trajectory ending to a landing pad  which is stationary and its position is being estimated by a vision based method using a single downward facing camera to  accurately land on the target.

Some intresting Results:
Landing is a very sensitive action to perform, directly maneuvering the drone to the land site without generating a favoured trajectory leads to very rash landing.Our controller was able to generate smooth trajectories and landed the drone without generating any high jerk or snap. Below is a plot of the landing trajectory that was recorded during experimentation.
